\section{Introduction}
Basic measurements from the prototype execution:

\begin{itemize}
\item We want to run our update protocol end-to-end, from proposal submission to activation and measure elapsed time, excluding (or simulating) the human delays. We start with a single user and scale up to N users running the protocol concurrently.

\item We want to measure the size impact on the blockchain for storing all the new events from the update protocol. For example, we can scale up on the number of users for a specific point in time, or we can measure size as time increases with a fixed number of users actively participating. 

\end{itemize}
