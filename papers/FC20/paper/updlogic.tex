%Activation Phase
%the activation phase is not a re-approval phase, it is just there to guard against chain split.s
%It is not relevant to UPs that dont impact consensus (adoption threshold = 0%)
%For those that do impact, adoption threshold = the honest stake threshold assumption of the consensus protocol. We make the assumption that if a UP is approved then all honest stake will eventually upgrade.
%To mitigate risk of chain split by accident (activation too early), we propose the concept of the activation lag.

%\paragraph{What is Update Logic}
%Update Logic = Metadata-Driven Software Updates

One size does not fit all and surely, all software updates are not the same. There are software updates with totally different characteristics that require a totally different \emph{update policy} to be adopted. For example such characteristics could be:
%We have pointed out many times that software updates are not all the same. There are many different perspectives for viewing SUs, which call for a specialized \emph{software update policy}. Software updates can be distinguished by the following dimensions:
\begin{itemize}
\item The reason of change (a bug-fix, or a security-fix versus a change request, or a new feature request).
\item The priority of change (e.g., high/medium/low).
\item Impact of change (e.g., whether it impacts the consensus protocol, or not).
\item Type of protocol change (hard/soft/velvet fork)
\item The complexity of deployment (e.g., high/medium/low)
%\item Size of change (e.g., man-effort required to be implemented).
%\item Platform-specific change (Linux, Windows MacOS etc.)
\end{itemize}
These and many other characteristics comprise the essential context of a software update and should be clearly described in the respective metadata, which are reviewed and approved by the stake majority.

We propose a software update logic that is \emph{metadata driven}. A logic that distinguishes one SU from another and applies the appropriate update policy. In the section, we describe our proposal for achieving such a decentralized metadata-driven, software update mechanism.

\subsection{Decentralized Software Update Metadata} 
A software update is inherently accompanied by meta-information that describes the update and sets it into the appropriate context. Therefore, we could say that every software update comprises a rich set of update meta-data that ultimately should drive the whole upgrade process. We distinguish several categories of metadata that result to a holistic view of a software update. The proposed list of update metadata can be found in the appendix. % The list of metadata categories presented next is indicative and aims at justifying the concept, therefore it is by no means complete, or restrictive in any way:

%We have described different aspects of meta-information that could accompany a software update. The purpose was not to propose a complete list of metadata but rather to point out how important is the software update mechanism to be metadata driven. In the following subsections, we provide examples of such exploitation of software update metadata in the phase of activation.

\subsection{Update Policies} 
An \emph{update policy} is a method to apply a customized activation of a software update driven by its metadata (i.e., by the software update context). For example, it is reasonable to assume that a high priority security fix must be activated with a different speed than a \say{nice to have} new feature. At the same time, for software updates that impact the consensus protocol, we need to be cautious not to cause a chain split by a premature activation of a software update. Therefore, there exist software updates for which we need to go fast and others for which we need to be cautious and slow down.

So far, we have discussed delegation for special categories as a method to speed-up (indirectly) the time to activation for a software update. In the following subsections, we discuss two other factors that impact directly the activation speed of a software update and thus enable update policies and also propose ways to guard against chain splits.
 
% In our proposal, we enable update policies and at the same time guard against chain splits in three ways: a) With the delegation to expert pools, b) with appropriate adjustment of the \emph{adoption threshold} and c) with the use of the \emph{activation lag}.
% We have discussed in the delegation section why it is important critical categories of software updates to be delegated to expert pools and why this will enable overall a faster time to activation. In the next subsections, we discuss the adoption threshold and the activation lag.

%An update policy is a way to customize the activation speed of a SU based on the type of the SU, which is deduced by the SU's metadata. We want to follow a metadata-driven activation approach. 
%An update policy can be enabled by two things:
%A) Delegation to expert pools
%B) adoption threshold (activation phase) and activation lag (activation phase)
%Activation lag is determined by
%Deployment complexity
%Soft/Hard fork type of change


\subsubsection{Examples of Update Policies}
In table \ref{update-policies-table}, we present some indicative examples of various update policies. In these examples an update policy is expressed as the triple: (Delegation, Adoption Threshold, Activation Lag). We see, for different examples of SUs, how to achieve the specified activation goal (speed-up or slow-down) with a specific update policy. Note that the various characteristics of the software update, such as the type of the change, the priority/criticality, etc., that appear in the first column and drive the deployment goal, have been described in the SU metadata and have been reviewed and approved by the stake majority during the Ideation phase.
