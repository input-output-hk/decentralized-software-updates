\section{Additional Background} \label{preliminaries}
We denote the security parameter by $\lambda$ and use ``$||$'' as concatenation operator 
(i.e., if $a$ and $b$ are two strings then by $a||b$ we denote the concatenation of $a$ and $b$). 
For a finite set $Q$, $x\from Q$ denotes a sampling of $x$ from $Q$ 
with uniform distribution. 
We use the abbreviation \ppt\ that stands for probabilistic polynomial time. We use $\poly(\cdot)$
 to indicate a generic polynomial function. 
When it is necessary to refer to the randomness $r$ used by and algorithm $A$ we use the following notation: $A(\cdot;r)$.
We say a function $\negligible$ is {\em negligible} if for every positive integer $c$ there is an integer $N_c$ such that for all $x > N_c$, $|\negligible(x)|< 1/x^c$.
We say $a \stackrel{\text{negl}}{\leq} b$ for real values $a, b$ to mean that $a \leq b + \negligible(\lambda)$ for negligible function $\negligible$.
We denote with $[n]$ the set  $\{1,\dots,n\}$, with $\mathbb{F}$ an arbitrary (but fixed) finite field and with $\mathbb{N}$ the set of non-negative integer.
