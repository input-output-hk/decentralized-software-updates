\section{Security Analysis}
A cryptographic modeling of our software updates protocol, in order to prove its security properties. \nnote{do we need something like that?}

From a security perspective, our proposal must ensure that:
a) any stakeholder will always be able to submit an update proposal to be voted by the stakeholders community, b) an update proposal that is not approved by the stake majority will never be applied, c) an update proposal that it is approved by the stake majority will be eventually applied, d) an update proposal that the stake majority decides that it has a higher priority than some other proposal, will take higher priority, e) it will provide guarantees for the authenticity and safety of the downloaded software and finally f) it will protect against chain splits, during activation of the proposed updates.
