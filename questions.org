* Tallying the votes
  According to the ~fc20-updates~ paper, votes should be counted when the voting
  period ends. The problem with this is that:
  - we will be using more resources for counting all the votes at once. So we
    will see spikes of CPU usage at the nodes at the end of voting periods. This
    might be a vulnerability.
  - if we have a couple of empty slots where counting should have taken place,
    we have to count votes of several periods at once. This will lead to even
    more resource consumption.

  Are we ok with this?
