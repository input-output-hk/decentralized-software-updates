This repository contains research output (papers, specifications, models, and
executable software) about decentralized software updates for blockchain
systems. Our research focuses on defining a protocol that covers the life cycle
of software updates, which consists of:

- ideation: the definition and specification of an update proposal, similar to
  [Bitcoin](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips) or
  [Ethereum](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs) improvement proposals.
- implementation: the actual implementation of improvement proposals.
- activation: the activation of new software version across nodes in the
  blockchain.


This work is funded by the [Priviledge](https://priviledge-project.eu/) project,
and these results will be incorporated into the
[Voltaire](https://cardanoroadmap.com/en/voltaire/) release of Cardano.

The research roadmap can be found in [our
wiki](https://github.com/input-output-hk/decentralized-software-updates/wiki/Roadmap).

## Formal specification

The formal specification is written in `LaTeX`. It can be found in the
[`formal-spec`](./formal-spec) folder. A compiled pdf can be found [here](https://hydra.iohk.io/job/Cardano/decentralized-software-updates/decentralizedUpdatesSpec/latest/download-by-type/doc-pdf/decentralized-updates).

We use [`nix`](https://nixos.org/nix/download.html) to achieve not only
reproducible software builds, but also reproducible document builds across
developers machines. This means that anybody who clones this code should be able
to build the software and documents without requiring any additional setup other
than having `nix` installed. But of course, the use of `nix` is not required.

When using `nix` it is recommended that you setup the cache, so that it can
reuse built artifacts, reducing the compilation times dramatically:

If you are using [NixOS](https://nixos.org/) add the snippet below to your
`/etc/nixos/configuration.nix`:

```
nix.binaryCaches = [
  "https://cache.nixos.org"
  "https://hydra.iohk.io"
];

nix.binaryCachePublicKeys = [
  "hydra.iohk.io:f/Ea+s+dFdN+3Y/G+FDgSq+a5NEWhJGzdjvKNGv0/EQ="
];
```

If you are using the `nix` package manager next to another operating system put
the following in `/etc/nix/nix.conf` if you have a system-wide `nix`
installation , or in `~/.config/nix/nix.conf` if you have a local installation:

```
substituters        = https://hydra.iohk.io https://cache.nixos.org/
trusted-public-keys = hydra.iohk.io:f/Ea+s+dFdN+3Y/G+FDgSq+a5NEWhJGzdjvKNGv0/EQ= cache.nixos.org-1:6NCHdD59X431o0gWypbMrAURkbJ16ZPMQFGspcDShjY=
```

The PDF corresponding to the formal specification can be built by changing the
working directory to `formal-spec` and then running:

```sh
nix-shell --pure --run "make"
```

## Executable specification

The executable specifications for the update mechanism can be found in the
[`executable-spec`](executable-spec/) folder.

To test the executable specifications run:

```sh
stack test --nix --file-watch
```

To play with the generated traces you can use the `ghci` repl. For instance, if
using `stack` you can enter the repl as follows:

```sh
stack --nix repl decentralized-updates
```

Once in the repl, one can obtain a random trace as follows:

```sh
位 > import  Control.State.Transition.Generator
位 > :set -XTypeApplications
位 > import Cardano.Crypto.Hash.Short (ShortHash)
位 > randomTrace @(IDEATION ShortHash) 100
```

## Contributing

Make sure:

- your editor supports [`editorconfig`](https://editorconfig.org/).
- you have the latest version of
  [`stylish-haskell`](https://github.com/jaspervdj/stylish-haskell/) installed
  (we use features that are not in Hackage yet, so make sure to build from
  source).
- Make sure your editor runs `stylish-haskell` on save.

We try to adhere to the coding standard explained
[here](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-wallet/wiki/Coding-Standards)
