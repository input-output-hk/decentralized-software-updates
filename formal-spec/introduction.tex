\subsection{Scope}
\label{sec:scope}

In this specification we define an update protocol that covers the different
phases of the software update process for blockchain systems. The following
aspects are outside the scope of the current specification:

\begin{description}
\item[voting incentives] we assume that honest parties will participate in the
  voting process. In addition, we use delegation as a means to ensure high
  participation in the voting process. However, in reality an incentive
  mechanism might be needed for ensuring this.
\item[upgrade incentives] as with voting, parties might need an incentive for
  upgrading to a new version of the software.
