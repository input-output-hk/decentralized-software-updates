* Context

*** Priviledge project
    - Funded by EU's Horizon 2020
    - IO Research goal: develop and validate an update protocol for Cardano.

*** The update mechanism in a nutshell
    - Three phases: ideation, approval, activation.
    - Commit-reveal scheme.
    - Voting process in ideation and approval phases.
      - Vote confidence: for, against, or abstain.
    - Endorsements in activation phase.
    - Proposals have priority.

* Main challenges of an update protocol

*** Seamlessly switching between versions
    - Solved by Edsko's HFC.
    - HFC needs to know: *if and when version changes take place*
    - Who provides this information?

*** Digression: Cardano's architecture

***** Network

***** Consensus
      - Where the HFC lives

***** Ledger
      - Processes transaction payload
      - Update in transactions
      - Thus: ledger must inform *if and when version changes take place*

* The ledger API

*** Pure functions

    #+BEGIN_SRC haskell
      :: ( ... ) => st -> d -> Either err st
      --   ^
      --   |
      --   ---- constraints on st, d (e.g. which information they need to provide
      --        which operations they should support)
    #+END_SRC

* How to property test the ledger API

*** Plain old PBT for ledger functions
    Quintessential example of PBT:

    #+BEGIN_SRC haskell
      prop_reverse :: [Int] -> Bool
      prop_reverse xs = reverse (reverse xs) == xs
    #+END_SRC

***** Generating states
      If ~f~ is a function of a ledger API we could write:

      #+BEGIN_SRC haskell
        prop_i_f :: st -> tx -> Bool
      #+END_SRC

      Problems:
      - ~st~ large and complex
        - => large and complex generators
      - ~st~ has invariants generators have to satisfy
        - => generators tightly coupled with implementation
        - => logic duplication

***** An algebra of ledger functions
      We would like to express properties about combination of ledger function
      applications:

      #+BEGIN_SRC haskell
        f0 (f1 st tx0) tx1 == ???
      #+END_SRC

      We need a "ledger algebra".

***** We need sequences of transactions

******* Example: approval of a proposal
        - We need several actions:
          - SIP commit
          - SIP reveal
          - SIP votes
          - Implementation commit
          - Implementation reveal
          - Implementation votes
        - Using a couple of function calls is not enough.

******* Another example: 2 approved proposals
        Important for testing the queuing mechanism.

*** From sequences of actions to traces
    Applying sequences of actions:
    - allow to generate "interesting cases"
      - e.g. 2 proposals get queued
    - solves the problem of having to generate state
      - albeit at the expense of potentially introducing other problems.
***** What are traces
      - Sequence of actions and ensuing state.
      - Invalid actions are also recorded in the trace.
        - Useful to test unexpected rejections.
        - And also expected ones! (Does a double spending transaction actually
          gets rejected?)
***** Which properties we can express on traces
******* Money is constant in the system
        #+BEGIN_SRC haskell
          moneyIsConstant trace =
            forall (states trace)
                   (\st ->
                     reserves st0 + balance (utxo st0) === reserves st + balance (utxo st)
                   )
            where
              st0 = initialState trace
        #+END_SRC

******* No double spending
        #+BEGIN_SRC haskell
          noDoubleSpending trace =
            forall (distinctIndices $ length trace)
                   (\(i, j) -> txins (actionAt i trace) /== txins (actionAt j trace))
        #+END_SRC

******* Protocol versions increase monotonically
        #+BEGIN_SRC haskell
          propVersionsMonotonicallyIncrease trace =
            isAscending $ fmap protocolVersion (states trace)
        #+END_SRC

******* And more interesting properties
        ... which we will see next.

* How to generate traces

*** How it was done in Byron
    - try our best to generate valid signals
      - masking off errors (e.g. UTxO generation without double spending)
      - needed when composing multiple rules
      - required intimate knowledge of the rules
        - generators looked in the rules state
    - influenced by interpreting (SOS) inference-rules as generators.

***** Disadvantages
      - tight coupling tests and implementation
      - complex generators
      - way too complex shrink functions
      - slow generators

*** The approach we took
    - keep calm and generate actions ...
    - but you still need some constraints on the generated data.
    - compositionality via modeling of "external disturbances".

***** System under test
      [[../test/SystemUnderTest.hs::19][module SystemUnderTest]]

***** Test scenario
      [[../test/Trace/Scenario.hs::22][module Trace.Scenario]]

      - Scenario constrains the generation, e.g. provides some context.
      - ... but also it [[../test/Trace/Generation.hs::26][uniquely determines]] a trace (credit to Edsko).
        #+BEGIN_SRC haskell
          elaborateTrace :: forall s t . HasScenario s t => Scenario t -> Trace s t
        #+END_SRC
      - What are the functions from ~HasScenario~ that ~elaborateTrace~ needs?
      - A function from scenarios to traces makes shrinking more tractable.
      - Why two type parameters in ~HasScenario~?

***** Modeling external disturbances
      - Thanks Nick for pointing out this.
      - If a property holds when tested in isolation, but not when integrated,
        then it must be because of the effect of other sub-systems (always
        assuming good coverage).
      - Determine how the sub-system can be influenced by other sub-systems by
        means of changes in the SUT state (includes SUT environment).
      - Model these changes as SUT actions.

      #+BEGIN_SRC haskell
          data SUTAct UpdateSUT
            = TickAct
            | UpdateAct (Update.Payload MockSIP MockImpl)
            | SIPStakeDistChange      (VoterId MockSIP)
                                      (VoterId MockSIP)
                                      Stake
            | ImplStakeDistChange     (VoterId MockSIP)
                                      (VoterId MockSIP)
                                      Stake
            | EndorersStakeDistChange (EndorserId (Protocol MockImpl))
                                      (EndorserId (Protocol MockImpl))
                                      Stake
      #+END_SRC

***** Dumb generation (and better shrinking)
      Generation uses the "update specifications" of the scenario:
      #+BEGIN_SRC haskell
        -- | Specification of a test-case update. This contains all the information
        -- required for an update to be activated, which includes:
        --
        -- * SIP payload
        --
        -- * Ideation payload
        --
        data UpdateSpec =
          UpdateSpec
          { getUpdateSpecId   :: !SpecId
            -- ^ This should uniquely identify the update spec.
          , getSIPSubmission  :: !(Submission MockSIP)
          , getSIPRevelation  :: !(Revelation MockSIP)
          , getImplSubmission :: !(Submission MockImpl)
          , getImplRevelation :: !(Revelation MockImpl)
          } deriving (Eq, Show)
      #+END_SRC

              -> VotersBehavior
              -> UpdateSpec
              -> Gen UpdateAction
            genActionsFor sipVotersBehavior implVotersBehavior aSpec =
              -- TODO: we also need to generate actions in which the signature of the
              -- action does not verify.
              frequency [ (20, genAction)
                        , (1, pure JustTick)
                        ]
              where
                genAction =
                  oneof [ -- Ideation
                          pure $ SIPCommit $ getUpdateSpecId aSpec
                        , pure $ SIPReveal $ getUpdateSpecId aSpec
                        , fmap SIPVote
                          $ genSIPVote participants (Just sipVotersBehavior) aSpec

******* No need to inspect the ledger state (unlike Byron)
        - Action generation doesn't even have access to it.
        - Less coupling with SUT.
******* Dumb generation works very well
        - Example: can find an example of two queued proposals.
        - Generation is much simpler.
        - Less chances of masking off errors by trying to generate valid traces
          only.
          - No need of complex mutation strategies.
******* Generation uses some symbolic references
        - It improves shrinking.

******* No hashing or signing needed

        - Commitable
        - Identifiable
        - Signed

*** Relation with state machine testing
    The approach described above sound familiar to you?

***** Reason for not using SM testing
      - We did not know in advance how similar the two approaches will be.
      - Not testing an impure system.

***** A side-by-side comparison would be extremely useful
      - Better to use existing libraries and techniques.

* Expressing properties of the update mechanism
*** The update mechanism in a nutshell
    - Three phases: ideation, approval, activation.
    - Proposals submitted using a commit-reveal scheme.
    - Voting process in ideation and approval phases.
      - Vote confidence: for, against, or abstain.
    - Endorsements in activation phase.
    - Proposals have priority.
    - Proposals specify one dependency.

*** Some test cases
***** SIP approval

      - [[../test/Test/Cardano/Ledger/UpdateSpec.hs::35][UpdateSpec]]

*** Using quick check for obtaining examples
    - SIP's are expired.

***** Examples might surprise you
      - Example of an *obsolete proposal*:
        - i.e. proposals that can never be adopted since they supersede a
          version lower than the current version.
      - I thought a minimal counterexample would have at least two proposals.
      - You only need one:
        - submit the same proposal twice:
          - the first time it'll get activated,
          - the second time it'll get rejected as obsolete.
      - Found after making generators "dumber"
        - Credit goes to Edsko for encouraging further simplifications.

*** What are desirable properties

***** Reveal only after stable commit
***** Stable means stable
      An event becomes stable after the exact number of slots that corresponds
      to the stability window pass.
***** No unrighful rejections of update payload
***** Votes are correctly tallied
***** Priorities are honored
***** Endorsements are correctly tallied

*** Expressing properties was challenging

***** Reliance on ~stateOf~
      - We did not want to break encapsulation of the ledger state.
      - If the system reported ~stateOf == Unknown~ most property would be
        vacuously true.

***** Completeness
      - Are we missing important checks
      - What are our (implicit) assumptions?

***** Checking that endorsements are correctly tallied
      - How do we express this?
      - We had to replicate the tallying process.
      - There are several endorsement periods.
      - A lot of computation involved for a single property:
        - for each proposal:
          - for each endorsement period:
            - when does it start being endorsed?
            - when does it stop?
            - where are the tally-points in the endorsement period?

******* Complex computations led to an idea
        - Use ~stateOf~ to multiplex the trace in sequences of events per update
          specification.

*** Multiplexing of trace into events
    #+BEGIN_SRC haskell
      data UpdateEvent
         = E { eventState    :: UpdateState
             -- ^ State that defines the event. An event occurs at the earliest state
             -- in which the state of an update proposal changes.
             , eventFragment :: TraceFragment UpdateSUT
             -- ^ Longest trace fragment for which the update specification is in
             -- 'eventState'.
             --

    - We can describe the protocol as a state machine.
    - Easier to think about properties.
    - We can also check the state query API ~stateOf~.

* Conclusions
*** Dumb generation works really well
    - Keep generation simple
    - Have good shrinking
    - Decoupling implementation and tests
*** Dumb generation needs a test setup
*** The importance of having research projects within IOHK
*** Do not recommend using these ideas right away
    - Investigate the use of state-machine testing
      - More reuse.
      - Our (Haskell) community benefits as well.


* Other content to include

*** TODO Review your code and see if there are other things worth mentioning
* Random thoughts
  - Importance of research project for investigating testing framework ideas.
    - Discarded state machine testing.
      - Although some ideas were applied in some other form in the current
        setup.
      - Failed attempts served as:
        - lessons
        - inspiration

* Do not forget
  Check slack for other considerations I made in the #sl-formal-spec channel.
